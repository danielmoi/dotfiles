# Vim Help Tips


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Notation 
<Key>           This is how a key is notated

<C-j>           Control key, with the 'j' key

{descriptor}    the "{" indicates "this is what i'm describing inside"
<C-{motion}>    Control key, with a "motion" ("motion" is what vim uses for "direction")

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Navigating in :help {command}
<C-]>         Go "into" the help text (when there is a hotlink)

<C-o>         Go to previous help page

## Useful help commands
:help           Enter help
:help CTRL-A    This gives help on the CTRL-A command ("control character")
:only           Make the current window the only one on the screen, all other windows are closed
